I’m working on data changes for my app, and I want to update multiple features at once: change all `"unknown"` values to `"no"` for the features `transactionLimits`, `bitcoinAddressType`, `taprootTransactions`, and `submarineSwaps` across all wallet JSONs. This should be reflected in the comparison table display and tooltips consistently.

Here’s the current `ComparisonTable.tsx`:

```tsx

Please:

Suggest Data Changes:
Provide a script or instructions to update all wallet JSON files (e.g., in src/data/wallets/ or wherever they’re stored) to:
Find any of these features (transactionLimits, bitcoinAddressType, taprootTransactions, submarineSwaps) with the value "unknown" and replace it with "no".
Leave other values (e.g., "yes", "custom", or objects like { "value": "custom", "customText": "..." }) unchanged.
Example transformation:

// Before
"features": {
  "transactionLimits": "unknown",
  "bitcoinAddressType": "unknown",
  "taprootTransactions": "unknown",
  "submarineSwaps": "unknown",
  "platform": ["android"]
}
// After
"features": {
  "transactionLimits": "no",
  "bitcoinAddressType": "no",
  "taprootTransactions": "no",
  "submarineSwaps": "no",
  "platform": ["android"]
}
Verify Rendering:
Ensure ComparisonTable.tsx renders these features with "no" correctly (it should already use the "no" icon and tooltip from FeatureTooltip based on existing logic).
Check that FeatureTooltip pulls the correct translation (e.g., featureStatus.values.no.title) for these updated values.
Update Translations (if needed):
Suggest any necessary updates to en.json to ensure featureStatus.values.no has appropriate tooltips for these features. For example:
transactionLimits: "No transaction limits"
bitcoinAddressType: "No specific address type supported"
taprootTransactions: "No Taproot transaction support"
submarineSwaps: "No submarine swap support"
Example (using a generic "no" for simplicity, or suggest feature-specific if preferred):

"featureStatus": {
  "values": {
    "no": { "label": "No", "title": "Feature not supported" }
  }
}
Test:
Confirm that a wallet with these features set to "no" (previously "unknown") displays as "No" with the correct icon and tooltip in the table (e.g., "No submarine swap support" for submarineSwaps).
Don’t modify ComparisonTable.tsx unless there’s a specific rendering issue with "unknown" values that needs fixing for this change.
Let me know the script/instructions for updating the wallet JSONs, any suggested en.json changes, and confirm that these features with "no" render correctly in the table after the data update!
