I’ve updated the wallet descriptions successfully, and they’re displaying correctly. However, I’ve noticed a new issue in `ComparisonTable.tsx`: since we froze the wallet names (left column) and feature titles (top row) to stay visible while scrolling, the tooltips for wallet names and feature titles (from `WalletTooltip` and `FeatureTooltip`) don’t fully display—they’re being covered by the frozen wallet titles row. I want the tooltips to appear above the frozen elements so they’re fully visible.

Please:

Fix Tooltip Display:
Adjust ComparisonTable.tsx to ensure tooltips (from WalletTooltip for wallet names and feature titles, and FeatureTooltip for feature values) appear above the frozen wallet titles row and feature titles row.
Likely causes:
The z-index of the sticky elements (e.g., z-index: 10) is higher than the tooltips’ default stacking context.
The table’s overflow settings might be clipping the tooltips.
Suggested fix:
Increase the z-index of the tooltip containers (e.g., in FeatureTooltip and WalletTooltip) to a higher value (e.g., z-index: 20) so they stack above the sticky elements.
Ensure the parent container (e.g., table or surrounding div) doesn’t clip tooltips with overflow: hidden—adjust to overflow: visible if needed.
If the current tooltip implementation (using title and data-tooltip) can’t be positioned above, consider switching to a CSS solution (e.g., :hover with pseudo-elements) or a library like @radix-ui/react-tooltip for better control.
Update Related Files:
If changes are needed in FeatureTooltip.tsx or WalletTooltip.tsx (e.g., adding z-index), provide those updates too.
Test:
Confirm that hovering over a wallet name (left column) and a feature title (top row) shows the full tooltip above the frozen elements, not covered by them.
Test with a wallet like "Bitkit" and a feature like "Platform" to ensure both WalletTooltip and FeatureTooltip work.
Don’t modify unrelated functionality (e.g., wallet descriptions, feature rendering) unless necessary to fix this issue.
Let me know how you fixed the tooltip display (e.g., z-index changes, CSS adjustments, or library suggestion), provide any updated code for ComparisonTable.tsx, FeatureTooltip.tsx, or WalletTooltip.tsx, and confirm the tooltips are fully visible above the frozen rows!
