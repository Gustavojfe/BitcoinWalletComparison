The next task is to invert the KYC values: rename the `kyc` feature to `noKyc` and flip all `"yes"` values to `"no"` and all `"no"` values to `"yes"` across all wallet data. This should be reflected in `ComparisonTable.tsx`, the wallet JSON files, and translations in `en.json`.

Here’s the current `ComparisonTable.tsx`:

```tsx
[Insert your full ComparisonTable.tsx code here]
Please:

Update ComparisonTable.tsx:
Replace any references to the kyc feature with noKyc in the rendering logic (e.g., check feature names in renderFeatureStatus or data processing).
Ensure the flipped logic is understood: "yes" for noKyc means no KYC is required, "no" means KYC is required. Adjust any display or tooltip logic if needed to reflect this semantic change.
Suggest Data Changes:
Provide a script or instructions to update all wallet JSON files (e.g., in src/data/wallets/ or wherever they’re stored) to:
Rename the kyc key to noKyc in the features object.
Flip values: "yes" becomes "no", "no" becomes "yes", leaving other values (e.g., "custom") unchanged.
Example transformation:
json

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// Before
"features": {
  "kyc": "yes",
  "platform": ["android"]
}
// After
"features": {
  "noKyc": "no",
  "platform": ["android"]
}
Update Translations:
Suggest updates to en.json to reflect the noKyc feature. Replace kyc entries with noKyc and adjust tooltip meanings:
featureStatus.values.yes → featureStatus.values.no (for "no KYC required").
featureStatus.values.no → featureStatus.values.yes (for "KYC required").
Example:
json

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// Before
"featureStatus": {
  "values": {
    "yes": { "label": "Yes", "title": "KYC required" },
    "no": { "label": "No", "title": "No KYC required" }
  }
}
// After
"featureStatus": {
  "values": {
    "no": { "label": "No", "title": "No KYC required" },
    "yes": { "label": "Yes", "title": "KYC required" }
  }
}
Test:
Verify that a wallet with noKyc: "no" displays as "No" with a tooltip "No KYC required", and noKyc: "yes" displays as "Yes" with "KYC required".
Don’t modify unrelated functionality (e.g., search, tooltips) unless necessary for this change.
Let me know how you updated ComparisonTable.tsx, provide the script/instructions for flipping wallet JSON data, suggest the en.json updates, and confirm the display reflects the inverted logic correctly!
